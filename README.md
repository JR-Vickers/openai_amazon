# OpenAI-to-Z Challenge

This repo contains work for the [OpenAI-to-Z](https://openai.com/openai-to-z-challenge/) checkpoints.  Each checkpoint is housed in a Python notebook.  To run it locally, you can quickly install all the libraries by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Checkpoint 2:
The jupyter notebooks contain detailed notes for each of the requirements set for in the Checkpoints document.

The visualizations don't display properly in GitHub preview mode.  Outputs can be previewed in the 'outputs' subdirectory.  If Checkpoint 2 is too large to view in Github, just download the file and open it in your browser.
