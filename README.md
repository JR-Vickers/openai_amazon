# OpenAI-to-Z Checkpoints

This repo contains work for the [OpenAI-to-Z](https://openai.com/openai-to-z-challenge/) checkpoints.  Each checkpoint is housed in a Python notebook.

The visualizations don't display properly in GitHub preview mode.  Outputs can be previewed in the 'outputs' subdirectory.
